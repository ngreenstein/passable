But, when you pass your Mac to someone else for a moment, you find that your setup doesn’t work for them. “Um, I moved the mouse and all the windows went away.” “How do I get back to that other screen?” “Why is the scrolling backwards?” “Ooh, you got six emails!”\r\n\r\nPassable can, with a single click, set your Mac up so anyone can use it comfortably. Click its icon in the menu bar and it disables **hot corners**, **Notification Center alerts**, and the **natural scroll direction**, so you can safely pass your Mac to anyone.\r\n\r\n**[Download Passable](https://github.com/ngreenstein/passable/blob/gh-pages/downloads/Passable02.app.zip?raw=true)**  \r\nRequires OS X 10.9 Mavericks\r\n\r\n## Using Passable\r\n\r\nWhen you launch the Passable app, its icon appears in the menu bar at the top of your screen.
