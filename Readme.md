# Passable

Your Mac is customized so you can work efficiently; you’re lost without your finely-tuned hot corners and notifications. But, when you pass your Mac to someone else for a moment, you find that your setup doesn’t work for them. “Um, I moved the mouse and all the windows went away.” “How do I get back to that other screen?” “Why is the scrolling backwards?” “Ooh, you got six emails!”

Passable can, with a single click, set your Mac up so anyone can use it comfortably. Click its icon in the menu bar and it disables **hot corners**, **Notification Center alerts**, and the **natural scroll direction**, so you can safely pass your Mac to anyone.

Requires OS X 10.9 Mavericks

## Using Passable

When you launch the Passable app, its icon appears in the menu bar at the top of your screen. Simply **click the icon to activate** Passable before passing your Mac to a friend or colleague, and click again to deactivate once he returns it.

## Customizing Passable

Control + click or **right - click its icon to customize** individually whether or not Passable affects hot corners, notifications, and scrolling. You can also configure Passable to launch automatically when you log in to your Mac and control whether it activates automatically when launched or waits for you to click its icon in the menu bar.
