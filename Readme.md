# Passable

Your Mac is customized so you can work efficiently; you’re lost without your finely-tuned hot corners and notifications. But, when you pass your Mac to someone else for a moment, you find that your setup doesn’t work for them. “Um, I moved the mouse and all the windows went away.” “How do I get back to that other screen?” “Why is the scrolling backwards?” “Ooh, you got six emails!”

Passable can, with a single click, set your Mac up so anyone can use it comfortably. Click its icon in the menu bar and it disables **hot corners**, **Notification Center alerts**, and the **natural scroll direction**, so you can safely pass your Mac to anyone.

# Using Passable

When you launch the Passable app, its icon appears in the menu bar at the top of your screen. Simply **click the icon to activate** Passable before passing your Mac to a friend or colleague, and click again to deactivate once he returns it.

# Customizing Passable

Just like your Mac, Passable can be configured to fit your workflow. Control + click or **right - click its icon to customize** individually whether or not Passable affects hot corners, notifications, and scrolling.
